# coinCount
Android Application :

#app idea : 
  * Problem definition : It is boring to count the coins by myself.
  * Possible Solution : <br> 
        Develop an application that can : <br>
          > Input _ Take image of coin placed on a (possibly) flat surface like table. <br>
          > Processing _ Search for coins in the image, most probably via image recognition algorithm. <br>
                       _ Sort out how many different types of coins are there and how many of each type are there via. appropriate feature
                          extraction. <br>
          > Output _ Give total count of different types of coin in numbers.
          
          
# Developing native OpenCV project from scratch:
   **Important Note before starting the steps:**
  - _Take attention to the path delimeter symbol "/" or "\" as used in linux and windows respectively while going through the steps for develoment._
  - _For e.g.,_
    - _".../downloads/opencv-android-sdk-v3.0/sdk/..." is a linux path syntax_
    - _whereas "...\downloads\opencv-android-sdk-v3.0\sdk\..." is a windows path syntax._

_Now, the steps to build a native android openCV project from scratch follow the following steps: **Assuming you have Android Studio installed with NDK support. Also have installed the android sdk and ndk**_

1. [Download OpenCV SDK for Android](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/3.2.0/opencv-3.2.0-android-sdk.zip/download) and decompress the zip file.

2. Create New Android Studio project with :
    * Check **Include C++ Support**
    * Choose **Empty Activity**
    * In C++ Support, check **-fexceptions** and **-frtti**

3. Import OpenCV library as module
   * File > New > Import Module...
   * Choose **.../opencv-android-sdk-v3.0/sdk/java** folder.
   * Unckeck **replace jar**, **replace lib**, **create gradle-style** options.
   
4. Make the gradle settings of `OpenCV library module` same as `your project app module`, so as to fit the SDK of your project module app, i.e., edit : `Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Module: openCVLibrary320)`. This means ** make the contents in the code block below match in `Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Module: openCVLibrary320)` and `Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Module: app)`**, `build.gradle` files.
    ```java
        compileSdkVersion 25 
        buildToolsVersion "25.0.2" 
        defaultConfig { 
            minSdkVersion 19
            targetSdkVersion 25
        } 
     ```

5. Add OpenCV module dependency in your app module, goto :
   `File` > `Project structure` > `Module:app (in the left vertical menu)` > `Dependencies tab` > `Add new module dependency - click +       (add) symbol and select Module Dependency option` > `choose OpenCV library module`
   
6. Copy `libs` directory from the path `PATH_TO_YOUR_OPENCV_SDK_DOWNLOAD/sdk/native` to `app/src/main` in your project folder and rename the copied folder to `jniLibs`.

7. Set `build.gradle (Module:app)` script like this:
    * Add `abiFilters` : make sure the code chunk looks exactly like this (this `externalNativeBuild` code block is inside        `defaultConfig` code block):
    ```java
       externalNativeBuild {
        cmake{
          cppFlags "-frtti -fexceptions"
          abiFilters 'x86', 'x86_64', 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'mips', 'mips64'
        }
       } 
    ```
    
    * Set the `sourceSets` source directory location of `jniLibs` to this directory : `app/src/main/jniLibs` (as a result of step 6):
      ```java
      sourceSets{
        main{
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['src/main/jniLibs']
        }
      }
      ```
     * The `build.gradle (Module:app)` script should look similar to 
       [this](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/Count_Coin/blob/master/app/build.gradle) now. Some values may vary according to your            project name, activity name, sdk versions used, opencv module version etc. which may be project specific values.
       
8. Configure the `CMakeLists.txt` files in `External Build Files` with:
   * After `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)` add the following:
     ```
     include_directories(C:/path_to_your_project/opencv-3.2.0-android-sdk/OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/jni/include)
     add_library( lib_opencv SHARED IMPORTED )
     set_target_properties(lib_opencv PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION                ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main/jniLibs/${ANDROID_ABI}/libopencv_java3.so)
     ```
     **Note:** 
       - make sure to correct the path syntax when you are working in linux, since above path syntax is for when working on windows              machine.
       - `lib_opencv` used in above code block will be made significant in the step below.
     
   * At the end of file add `lib_opencv` to `target_link_libraries` and the code block at the end of file looks like:
     ```
     target_link_libraries( # Specifies the target library.
                       native-lib
                       lib_opencv
                       # Links the target library to the log library
                       # included in the NDK.
                       ${log-lib} )
     ```
     
9. In the `AndroidManifest.xml` file grant permissions for the app to use `camera`, add the following before `<application>` tag starts:
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.front"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.front.autofocus"/>
    ```
    * The `AndroidManifest.xml` file looks similar to       [this]https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/Count_Coin/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) now.
