# coinCount
Android Application :

#app idea : 
  * Problem definition : It is boring to count the coins by myself.
  * Possible Solution : <br> 
        Develop an application that can : <br>
          > Input _ Take image of coin placed on a (possibly) flat surface like table. <br>
          > Processing _ Search for coins in the image, most probably via image recognition algorithm. <br>
                       _ Sort out how many different types of coins are there and how many of each type are there via. appropriate feature
                          extraction. <br>
          > Output _ Give total count of different types of coin in numbers.

It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.
   Since 2010 OpenCV was ported to the Android environment, it allows to use the full power of the library in mobile applications development. http://opencv.org/platforms/
